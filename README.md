# How does it help?
Imagine a scenario where you have a full spread, large image that should be printed on both sides of your ebook. Now, inside the interior file, each part of a full spread book needs to be placed separately. This program helps you select a folder containing a list of images and splits them into two halves, left and right, to save them in a target output folder.

# How to use?
Place a list of full spread images inside a folder and open the program, and select that folder as an input location. Now select the output folder again and then start the process. You'll have your split images ready, maintaining their original quality.

# If you're running the script and need the pip command:
```bash
pip install customtkinter pillow
```
